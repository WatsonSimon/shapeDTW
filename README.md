# shapeDTW and weightedDTW
This repository implements the algorithms proposed in paper: shapeDTW: shape Dynamic Time Warping, Pattern Recognition, 2018. Paper can be download from here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01601.pdf

A shape-embedded dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. 
The shape descriptor can be HOG1, derivative, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) or many others.

This repo also implements the algorithm proposed in paper: Weighted dynamic time warping for time series classification, Pattern Recognition, 2011.

The code was tested on UCR time series datasets.
