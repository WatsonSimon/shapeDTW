# shapeDTW
This repository implements the algorithms proposed in paper: shapeDTW: shape Dynamic Time Warping, Pattern Recognition.

A shape-embedded dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. 
The shape descriptor can be HOG1, derivative, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) or many others.

One similar algorithm is weighted-DTW, paper can be download from here: http://lig-membres.imag.fr/bisson/cours/M2INFO-AIW-ML/papers/Jeong11.pdf

The code was tested on UCR time series datasets.
